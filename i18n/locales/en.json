      "whenDoIGetPaid": "When do I get paid?",
      "whenDoIGetPaidAnswer": "Payouts happen once per month, typically on the 1st-5th of each month. You will receive a payout when your balance reaches the minimum threshold of €10.",
      "whyMinimum": "Why is there a €10 minimum?",
      "whyMinimumAnswer": "The minimum payout threshold helps reduce transaction fees and processing costs. This ensures that both you and Wihngo can operate efficiently. If you don't reach €10 in a month, your balance will roll over to the next month.",
      "whatIfNeverReach": "What happens if I never reach €10?",
      "whatIfNeverReachAnswer": "Your balance accumulates each month until you reach the €10 threshold. Once you reach it, you'll receive a payout on the next scheduled payout date. Your funds never expire.",
      "platformFee": "What is the platform fee?",
      "platformFeeAnswer": "Wihngo charges a 5% platform fee on all support received. This fee helps us maintain the platform, process payments, and continue improving Wihngo. 95% of every support payment goes directly to you.",
      "payoutMethods": "What payout methods are available?",

      "howToSupport": "How do I support a bird?",

      "whatIsSupport": "What is support used for?",

      "isCryptoSafe": "Is crypto safe?",
      "isCryptoSafeAnswer": "Crypto transactions are irreversible and require careful attention. Always double-check the wallet address and network before sending. Wihngo does not custody your crypto and cannot reverse transactions.",

      "cryptoPayoutVolatilityAnswer": "If you choose to receive payouts in crypto, you accept the risk of market volatility. The value of your payout may change between when it's calculated and when you receive it. Wihngo does not guarantee any specific value."
